It is a device tree for onda V989.

P.S. 08.08.2015 CM12 building was finished without any errors! It is a great news! 
I think that all necessary files for booting is included.
 
But i do not know how to flash it. (system & boot partitions)
I am tried to compile zip archive for PhilZ Touch Recovery but it finished with fatal error.

Guys, i need your help. Please pull request!
